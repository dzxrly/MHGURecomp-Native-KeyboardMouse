# NGX integration for MHGURecomp Enhanced

## Components and sources

The public headers and `LICENSE.txt` are from [NVIDIA/DLSS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS/tree/9981c6350dc58c0ce21f024fd65e31e851c31689), commit `9981c6350dc58c0ce21f024fd65e31e851c31689` (310.9.16). The SDK library and runtimes retain NVIDIA's separate terms; the project MIT license does not replace them. No private NR header is required: the host uses the public feature-18 enum slot and the runtime interface.

`runtime/nvn/vulkan/ngx_sdk.cpp` is a C interface around the official SDK, compiled with Visual Studio x64 tools to isolate the Microsoft C++ ABI from the MinGW host. It uses the renderer's existing Vulkan handles. It creates no additional Vulkan instance/device, injects no layer and uses no graphics-API translation.

```powershell
./tools/build_ngx.ps1 -VulkanInclude 'C:/path/to/Vulkan-Headers/include'
```

The build script downloads the pinned public static SDK library when missing and writes `build/mhgu-nvngx.dll`. The Windows release includes that adapter, the unmodified official SR and NR runtimes, and the pinned community SM89 NR runtime. The host reports unavailability if a selected component is missing.

## Bundled runtimes

Extract the complete Windows release. It includes all runtime files at the following paths relative to `mhgurecomp.exe`:

```text
mhgurecomp.exe
mhgu-nvngx.dll
nvngx_dlss.dll
dlss/nr/official/nvngx_dlssnr.dll
dlss/nr/sm89/nvngx_dlssnr.dll
```

- **Official:** the bundled, unmodified NVIDIA-signed NR 310.9.16.0 comes from NVIDIA's `rtx-remix-ngx_sdk_dlnr@2` dependency package, referenced by the [RTX Remix dependency manifest](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/dxvk-remix/blob/main/packman-external.xml). Select `NRRuntime = Official` to use it.
- **SM89:** the bundled compatibility runtime is the SF 310.9.16 build from [HoYoShadeHub-DLSSNR-Runtimes](https://github.com/thx114/HoYoShadeHub-DLSSNR-Runtimes/releases/tag/nr-310.9.16), asset `nvngx_dlssnr_310.9.16-SF.zip`. Explicitly select `NRRuntime = SM89` to use it. This is a community-modified binary, distinct from the official runtime; it matches [OpenNR](https://github.com/clshortfuse/openNR)'s compatibility output `CDFA6C1EC784867182164C7836F324F087B5C9F374D0C9FE46F54999FEABF3ED`.

Both NR runtimes are included in the same ZIP. NR defaults off, and **runtime selection is INI-only**: close the game, then set `[Graphics] NRRuntime = Official` (default) or `NRRuntime = SM89`. F1 has no runtime selector; its Reset/Save actions preserve this offline setting. Missing files and failures never substitute SM89 automatically. The runtime selection requires restarting; the other NR controls apply after Save in the running game. The updater refreshes bundled runtime files together with the program while preserving the INI selection. Keep runtime binaries out of Git; provide all four files in the clean Windows build folder before packing a release. The NVIDIA license and these origin notes accompany the binaries in the distribution.

## Dispatch and controls

Official uses public SDK dispatch. SM89 invokes the runtime's Vulkan snippet with parameter blocks from the initialized SDK and the same Vulkan device. This works around older driver cores that reject feature 18 before dispatch. The adapter name contains `nvngx.dll`, and non-tail-call wrappers retain the caller module expected by the snippet. It does not rename the game or patch its driver.

NR selects the original FP16 model, receives an opaque SDR scene/depth/motion, and evaluates before the HUD. INI/F1 expose intensity, style, local structure, local tone, skin structure, automatic skin masking and 1–3 effect layers. Auto Mask defaults on; Skin defaults to zero. Effect layers amplify one result's residual and never add model evaluations. See [graphics architecture and formula](../../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#graphics).

Basic NR and SR+NR have produced visible in-game output on RTX 4080 / driver 610.88 with the pinned SF model. This is not validation for RTX 20/30/50, arbitrary runtime builds or exhaustive scenes.
