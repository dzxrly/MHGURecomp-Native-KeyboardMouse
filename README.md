Built on [morerokk/MHGURecomp](https://github.com/morerokk/MHGURecomp), this enhanced Windows edition adds **native keyboard/mouse input and icon support, DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS 5 Neural Rendering**.

The enhanced edition has its own version in [VERSION](VERSION); the reviewed original-project baseline is in [UPSTREAM_VERSION](UPSTREAM_VERSION). Release titles contain those two numbers only, for example **0.1.0-0.11.7**. Git tags and updater comparisons use the enhanced-edition version, starting at **0.1.0**.

## Requirements and installation

- Windows 10/11, 64-bit; AVX2/FMA-capable CPU; Vulkan 1.2-capable GPU; at least 4 GB RAM and 1 GB VRAM for the base renderer. DLSS and NR have additional GPU, driver and memory requirements.
- Your own complete **Nintendo Switch MHGU 1.4.0** game files, with the update merged. The 3DS game is not supported.
- The supported client release is Windows. A Linux client build and test environment is not available.

Download `MHGURecomp-Enhancement-win_x86-64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/dzxrly/MHGURecomp-Native-KeyboardMouse/releases), extract it, then place both complete game folders here:

```text
Windows-MHGURecomp/
  mhgurecomp.exe
  mhgugame.dll
  mhgurecomp-updater.exe
  data/
    exefs/
    romfs/
  mods/Keyboard_Mouse_Input_Auto/
```

Keep all program dependencies from the archive. Start `mhgurecomp.exe`; the first start creates `mhgurecomp.ini`. Startup checks the supported game version. Keep the base game files unchanged and install changes through mods.

## Graphics and neural rendering

Graphics settings are in the INI's **[Graphics]** section. F1's **Graphics** page exposes the controls except the INI-only `NRRuntime` selection. Save changes; an asterisk marks a restart requirement. Audio has its own page.

Enable **Temporal upscaling / AA**, then choose exactly one of FSR 3.1, FSR 4 or DLSS SR / DLAA. DLSS offers **Ultra Performance → Performance → Balanced → Quality → DLAA**. `UpscaleQuality = DLAA` selects native-resolution anti-aliasing. Render sizes come from the SDK; NVIDIA App overrides can affect the actual size/model, which the menu and log report. Active temporal upscaling takes over MSAA/FXAA. FSR 4 needs a compatible build/AMD driver and falls back to FSR 3.1 if unavailable. DLSS failure is reported explicitly.

NR is a separate switch and also works with temporal upscaling off. The same ZIP includes the NGX adapter, official SR runtime, official NR runtime and community SM89 NR runtime. **Runtime selection is INI-only:** close the game and set `NRRuntime` under `[Graphics]` to `Official` (the default, RTX 50) or `SM89` (community RTX 40). F1 does not expose this selection, and failures never switch runtimes automatically. See [runtime configuration and sources](third_party/ngx/README.md).

| NR setting | INI key | Default | Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Model strength | `NRIntensity` | 0.5 | 0–2 |
| Style | `NRStyle` | Standard | Standard / Natural / Cinematic |
| Local structure | `NRLocalStructure` | 1 | 0–2 |
| Local tone | `NRLocalTone` | 0 | 0–2 |
| Skin structure | `NRSkinStructure` | **0** | 0–2 |
| Automatic skin mask | `NRAutoMask` | **On** | On / Off |
| Effect layers | `NRLayers` | 1 | **1–3** |

Each scene frame runs NR once. Layers 2/3 amplify the difference between that result and the original scene, then composite before the HUD; they do not run the model again. Skin 0 requests no skin-structure enhancement, while other model changes may remain. Detailed help appears in F1 and the INI. NR controls require a restart. Basic NR and SR+NR have been exercised on RTX 4080; RTX 50 and other GPU families remain unverified in this project.

## Keyboard and mouse

### Enable and configure

Close the program, set these values in `mhgurecomp.ini`, then start it again:

```ini
[Controls]
InputMode = Keyboard_Mouse_Input

[Mouse]
MouseSensitivity = 1.0
```

The default mode is `Original`; use `Keyboard_Mouse_Input` for the controls below. Controllers work in either mode. Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun and Bow automatically use **Ranged**; other Hunter weapons and Prowler use **Melee**. Equipment changes switch bindings and prompts without restarting.

### Enable keyboard/mouse prompts

The release includes `mods/Keyboard_Mouse_Input_Auto`. Enable it in **F1 → Mods**, then restart. It follows your equipment and game language automatically. Keep the whole folder; no separate download or generation is needed.

Bindings use physical QWERTY key positions. In game menus, confirm with right mouse in Melee or left mouse in Ranged; Space goes back. Original game menus use button navigation rather than pointer clicks. Press F2 to release the mouse; click the window to capture it again.

Press `/` to chat in town or quests, Enter to send and Esc to cancel. Change the chat key in **F1 → Controls**. During text entry, Ctrl+V pastes.

### Bow and Prowler

Bow uses Ranged. With the Bow sheathed, left mouse remains A for interaction; press R (game X) to draw. While drawn:

| Input               | Bow control type 1             | Bow control type 2                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Left mouse          | X: charge; release to shoot    | Configured game R: charge; release to shoot |
| Right mouse         | Configured game R: hold to aim | X: click to toggle aim                      |
| Mouse side button 5 | A: secondary Bow action        | A: secondary Bow action                     |

Mouse controls follow the game’s Bow control type and R/ZR swap option. Keyboard controls stay as in the main table; menus use left mouse to confirm. Bow prompts still show the base Ranged layout, so use this table for Bow mouse controls.

Prowler uses Melee: left mouse attacks and right mouse charges a boomerang. While charging, hold R / side button 5 for precision aim. With the weapon out, R guards and R+left mouse performs the overhead attack; with it put away, R+C guards. The wheel selects Support Moves; F uses one while sheathed, R+F while drawn. Original move requirements and gauge costs apply.

### Mouse sensitivity and camera options

Adjust **Mouse sensitivity** in F1, or `MouseSensitivity` in the ini (0.1–10). In the game’s own options, **Camera Speed** adjusts the quest camera and **Reticle Speed** adjusts bowgun/Bow aim and Binoculars; both apply immediately. Camera, Quick Aim and Scope inversion are configured separately in the game.

Original firing recovery, aiming delays and attack-turning restrictions still apply. Village cameras, fixed Ballista and Prowler special aiming retain the game’s turn-speed limits. Some handbook pages still show controller illustrations.

## Settings, files and multiplayer

F1 opens PC settings; Alt+Enter or F11 toggles fullscreen, F12 takes a screenshot and F7 cycles MSAA where available. The PC menu supports English/Spanish independently of the game's seven languages. Hints follow the last keyboard/mouse or controller input. Use arrows or Tab/Shift+Tab, Enter/left click to confirm, and Esc/F1 to go back.

| Content | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Settings / log | `mhgurecomp.ini` / `log.txt` beside the program |
| Windows save | `%APPDATA%\MHGURecomp\save\save_0\` |
| Mods / cheats | `mods/` / `cheats/` |
| Screenshots / shader cache | `shots/` / `cache/` |

To import a Switch save, back up the destination, then copy your `system` and `system_backup` into `save_0`.

Choose **Local Wireless** in the game. LAN/virtual-LAN players can discover rooms directly. Internet play uses the same compatible client, hub server and optional matchmaking key, configured under **F1 → Network**. Direct hosting requires reachable TCP/UDP port 39500 by default.

Put each mod in its own `mods/` directory. Enable/order it in **F1 → Mods**, then restart; later conflicting mods take priority. Put MHGU 1.4.0 cheat text files in `cheats/`; prefix a filename with `_` to disable it. The included Auto prompt mod follows equipment and game language. Optional monster-HP and Hub/Village settings are under Miscellaneous. Bonus downloads can be imported when a separately supplied `bonus/system` donor is present and `BonusContent = On`.

## Updates and troubleshooting

Download releases from this repository or use its included updater. Updates replace program files, bundled DLSS runtimes and Auto prompt resources while preserving game data, settings, saves and other mods.

- **Game-version warning:** use a complete Switch 1.4.0 dump with its update merged; leave its base files unchanged.
- **Controller prompts remain:** select `InputMode = Keyboard_Mouse_Input`, enable the bundled Auto mod and restart.
- **DLSS/NR unavailable:** inspect the actual status in F1 and the log; check the selected runtime, GPU and driver. Use SM89 explicitly on RTX 40.
- **Frame-time spikes:** start at 60 FPS with VSync and leave development graphics statistics disabled.
- **Report a problem:** include the enhanced-edition version, GPU/driver, graphics settings, reproduction steps and a copy of `log.txt` in [Issues](https://github.com/dzxrly/MHGURecomp-Native-KeyboardMouse/issues).
